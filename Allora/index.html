                    <h2 class="term-title">Agent</h2>
                    <p class="term-definition">A computational entity within the Allora Network that performs specific tasks, makes predictions, or provides services. Agents can be trained models, algorithms, or specialized programs that contribute to the network's collective intelligence.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="term-card">
                    <h2 class="term-title">Stake</h2>
                    <p class="term-definition">The process of locking up tokens as collateral to participate in network consensus, validation, or governance. Staking provides economic security and incentivizes honest behavior within the Allora ecosystem.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="term-card">
                    <h2 class="term-title">Slash</h2>
                    <p class="term-definition">A penalty mechanism where a portion of a participant's staked tokens are confiscated due to malicious behavior, network violations, or failure to meet performance requirements. Slashing ensures network integrity and discourages bad actors.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="term-card">
                    <h2 class="term-title">Oracle</h2>
                    <p class="term-definition">A data feed that provides external information to smart contracts and applications on the Allora Network. Oracles bridge the gap between on-chain and off-chain data, enabling decentralized applications to access real-world information.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="term-card">
                    <h2 class="term-title">Reputation</h2>
                    <p class="term-definition">A scoring system that tracks the historical performance and reliability of agents and participants in the Allora Network. Higher reputation scores typically result in greater rewards and reduced collateral requirements.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="term-card">
                    <h2 class="term-title">Inference</h2>
                    <p class="term-definition">The process of using trained machine learning models to make predictions or generate outputs based on input data. In Allora, inference is performed by agents to provide valuable services to the network.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="term-card">
                    <h2 class="term-title">Consensus</h2>
                    <p class="term-definition">The mechanism by which network participants agree on the state of the blockchain and validate transactions. Allora uses a consensus protocol that incorporates both traditional blockchain consensus and AI-driven decision making.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="term-card">
                    <h2 class="term-title">Rewards</h2>
                    <p class="term-definition">Token incentives distributed to participants for contributing computational resources, providing accurate predictions, maintaining network security, or participating in governance activities.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="term-card">
                    <h2 class="term-title">Validator</h2>
                    <p class="term-definition">A network participant responsible for verifying transactions, maintaining the blockchain, and participating in consensus. Validators stake tokens and earn rewards for their services while risking slashing for misbehavior.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="term-card">
                    <h2 class="term-title">Governance</h2>
                    <p class="term-definition">The decentralized decision-making process that allows token holders to propose and vote on network upgrades, parameter changes, and ecosystem developments within the Allora Network.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="term-card">
                    <h2 class="term-title">Liquidity</h2>
                    <p class="term-definition">The ease with which tokens can be bought or sold without significantly affecting their price. Liquidity is crucial for a healthy ecosystem and is often provided by liquidity providers in decentralized exchanges.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="term-card">
                    <h2 class="term-title">Delegation</h2>
                    <p class="term-definition">The process where token holders can delegate their staking power to validators without running their own infrastructure. Delegators earn a portion of the validator's rewards while the validator takes on the operational responsibilities.</p>
